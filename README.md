## Lab 16 AWS

For this lab we selected a past project (in this case, the basic Express Server), and deployed it to AWS using Elastic Beanstalk both from the terminal, and the GUI.

My approach to this lab is to revisit the class lecture and make sure I am completing all steps correctly.  

I successfully set up my `AWS` account this morning
